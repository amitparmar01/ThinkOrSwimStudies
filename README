This project contains scripts that define new studies for use with TD Ameritrade's ThinkOrSwim trading platform.

The scripts include:

* AccumulationDistributionBarCount - Indicates days of accumulation and distribution.

* ATRLabel - Adds a label to a chart showing the historical Average True Range and the range of the current period.

* ATRPercent - A graph showing the Average True Range over time as a percent of the current price.

* ATRValueWithGapIndicator - A graph showing the Average True Range over time as a value.  Gaps up or down are highlighted in green or red, respectively.

* BuyableGapUpIndicator - Adds a bubble indicating past buyable gaps-up.

* UpDownVolumeRatio - Ratio of the volume on up days versus down days.
