This project contains scripts that define new studies for use with TD Ameritrade's ThinkOrSwim trading platform.

The scripts include:

* AccumulationDistributionBarCount - Creates a chart of the count of days/weeks showing institutional accumulation and distribution. This is useful for measuring total accumulation/distribution in a base.

* ATRLabel - Adds a label to a chart showing the historical and current Average True Range.

* ATRPercent - Displays a chart showing the Average True Range over time as a percent of the current price.

* ATRValueWithGapIndicator - Displays a chart showing the Average True Range over time as a value.  Gaps up or down are highlighted in green or red, respectively.

* BuyableGapUpIndicator - Adds a chart bubble indicating past buyable gaps-up.

* Coppock Indicator - Displays a chart of Coppock Indicator with bubbles at each buy signal.

* Pocket Pivot - Adds a bubble on the daily chart when the stock had a Pocket Pivot buy point.

* UpDownVolumeRatio - Displays a chart of the ratio of the volume on up days versus down days.
